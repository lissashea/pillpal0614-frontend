## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone: https://github.com/lissashea/pillpal0614-frontend.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd myapp`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

Make sure to also set up and run the backend server for full functionality.

`http://localhost:8000`

## Configuration

The frontend application requires the backend server to be running and accessible. By default, it assumes the backend server is running at `http://localhost:8000/api`. If your backend server is running on a different URL or port, you can update the `BASE_URL` constant in `src/services/apiConfig.js`.

Additionally, the application uses token-based authentication. The authentication token is stored in the browser's local storage. Please ensure that your browser supports local storage.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can follow the deployment instructions specific to your hosting platform. Here are some general steps:

1. Build the production-ready optimized bundle: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` directory to your hosting environment.
